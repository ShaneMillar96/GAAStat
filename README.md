# GAAStat

A comprehensive GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) statistics and analytics platform built with .NET and React, designed to transform complex match data from CSV/Excel files into intuitive, actionable insights.

## üìä Project Overview

GAAStat revolutionizes how GAA teams and analysts work with match statistics by providing a modern web-based platform that ingests, processes, and visualizes match data. Instead of wrestling with confusing spreadsheets scattered across multiple tabs, users can upload their CSV/Excel files and immediately access clean, organized statistics through an intuitive dashboard.

The platform serves coaches, analysts, and team management who need to:
- Convert raw match data into meaningful insights
- Track player and team performance over time
- Access historical trends and comparisons
- Generate reports for strategic decision-making
- Visualize complex statistics in an easy-to-understand format

## üéØ Problem Definition

### The Challenge
Current GAA statistics management relies heavily on Excel spreadsheets that present several critical issues:

- **Data Fragmentation**: Statistics are scattered across multiple sheets within a single file, making holistic analysis difficult
- **Poor Usability**: Complex layouts and inconsistent formatting make data interpretation time-consuming and error-prone
- **Limited Analysis**: No built-in capability for historical trends, comparisons, or advanced analytics
- **Manual Processes**: Data entry and validation are manual, increasing the likelihood of errors
- **Accessibility**: Files are difficult to share and collaborate on, limiting team-wide insights
- **Scalability**: As seasons progress, managing multiple files becomes increasingly cumbersome

### The Solution
GAAStat addresses these challenges through:

- **Streamlined Data Ingestion**: Simple CSV/Excel upload functionality that automatically parses and validates match data
- **Centralized Database**: All match statistics stored in a structured PostgreSQL database optimized for analytics queries
- **Intuitive Web Interface**: Clean, modern dashboard presenting statistics in easy-to-read formats
- **Match-by-Match Analysis**: Each uploaded file represents a match, allowing users to drill down into specific game performance
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Automated calculation of key metrics including top scorers, turnovers, shots, total scores, and performance trends
- **Historical Insights**: Track performance over time with season and career statistics
- **Collaborative Platform**: Web-based access enables team-wide data sharing and analysis
